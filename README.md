🚗 Car Sales Dashboard Project

🔍 Objective:The goal was to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to track our sales performance over time, providing real-time insights to make data-driven decisions and identify trends for business growth.

🔄 Process:

KPI Development: Key metrics like Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) growth, and average sales prices were tracked to provide comprehensive performance monitoring.
Visualizations: Multiple charts were used to display trends and distributions:
Line Chart: YTD Sales Weekly Trend.
Pie Charts: Distribution of sales by body style and car color.
Map Chart: Sales based on dealer regions.
Tabular Grid: Company-wise sales trends and detailed sales information.

💡 Insights:

Sales Trends: The weekly sales trends gave us a clear picture of seasonality and peak performance weeks.
Product Preferences: Visualizations showed that certain body styles and colors contributed significantly to sales.
Regional Performance: The map chart helped identify high-performing regions, allowing for better resource allocation.

📊 Conclusion: The Dashboard offers real-time insights into critical metrics such as YTD sales, MTD sales, and YOY growth. It helps identify trends in sales by body style, color, region, and dealer performance, enabling data-driven business strategies and decision-making.
