🚗 Car Sales Dashboard Project

🔍 Objective:The goal was to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to track our sales performance over time, providing real-time insights to make data-driven decisions and identify trends for business growth.

🔄 Process:

KPI Development: Key metrics like Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) growth, and average sales prices were tracked to provide comprehensive performance monitoring.
Visualizations: Multiple charts were used to display trends and distributions:
Line Chart: YTD Sales Weekly Trend.
Pie Charts: Distribution of sales by body style and car color.
Map Chart: Sales based on dealer regions.
Tabular Grid: Company-wise sales trends and detailed sales information.

💡 Insights:

Sales Trends: The weekly sales trends gave us a clear picture of seasonality and peak performance weeks.
Product Preferences: Visualizations showed that certain body styles and colors contributed significantly to sales.
Regional Performance: The map chart helped identify high-performing regions, allowing for better resource allocation.

📊 Conclusion: The Car Sales Dashboard has provided us with a valuable tool to monitor and improve our sales strategies. By leveraging Power BI, we now have the ability to track critical KPIs in real time, optimize performance, and make informed decisions that drive business growth. This dashboard will be key to identifying new opportunities and enhancing customer satisfaction moving forward.
